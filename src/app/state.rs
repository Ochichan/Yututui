//! Grouped sub-states of [`App`] (Stage 2 of the re-architecture).
//!
//! The reducer historically kept ~70 flat fields on `App`; these structs gather the
//! cohesive per-domain groups so ownership reads clearly and future changes stay local.
//! Behaviour-preserving: the fields are the same, just nested (`app.search.input`).
